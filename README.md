Here's a `README.md` template that emphasizes the free usage of the dorks for GitHub search:

```markdown
# GitHub Dorks Collection

This repository contains a collection of GitHub search dorks that can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities, sensitive information, or other valuable insights from public GitHub repositories. These dorks are for free use and can be applied by security researchers, ethical hackers, or anyone interested in exploring public GitHub data.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a curated list of GitHub search queries (dorks) that can help in identifying exposed secrets, vulnerable code patterns, or other sensitive information across GitHub repositories. This resource is provided for educational and research purposes and should be used responsibly.

## Dorks

- The dorks in this repository are free for public use.
- They can be used to search for specific files or information within GitHub repositories, including but not limited to API keys, credentials, and configurations.
- This repository encourages responsible use for security research and improvement of GitHub repositories' security.

## How to Use

To use these dorks, simply copy the dork from the `githubdorks.txt` file and paste it into the GitHub search bar or use it programmatically with tools that support GitHub's search API.

### Example Usage

1. Go to [GitHub Search](https://github.com/search).
2. Paste any of the dorks from the `githubdorks.txt` file into the search bar.
3. View the results, which may show repositories or code containing sensitive information.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute more dorks or improvements to this collection. To contribute:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Add your dork or improvement.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new dork'`).
5. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Open a Pull Request to merge your changes.
